# Dot-Files
My custom configuration for i3-wm, vim, as well as other programs I use on my Arch setup.
I have these here to port my configurations between machines, but feel free to take a look if you're curious.

I take no credit for any of this. A lot of these files have either been inspired or copied off of the internet from somewhere.
